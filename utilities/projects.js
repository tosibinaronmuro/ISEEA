    projectName: "PROJECT H.E.L.P.",
    projectDetails: ` In March 2022, we heard about the story of
    a 15 years old girl in Galadimawa community in FCT-Abuja, who grew up witha father that constantly demoralized her and threatened to kill them. She developed chronic low self-esteem & an intense need to be loved and accepted which made her easy prey for a sexual predator. He took advantage of her low self-esteem & manipulated her into making nude video calls with him which he recorded and eventually, it found its way online. After a visit to the community, we birthed Project H.E.L.P. to teach children within about the importance of self-esteem and its place in preventing sexual abuse. We raised the sum of 193,000 naira through peer to peer fundraising campaign for the project.
