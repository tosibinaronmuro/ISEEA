                </h2>
                <p className="font-Poiret my-3  text-justify">
                  It was sometime in April 2020. It was a new day for many but
                  for a young girl forced to return home from the Nigerian Law
                  School due to Covid 19 pandemic, it did not feel like it. She
                  was going through another episode of chronic low self esteem
                  that made her shut out the world, cut off everyone, and bury
                  herself in books. But this day did not end with the usual
                  tears and cuddling a pillow to drown out the choking sounds of
                  her sobs because she stumbled on a book, 'Girl, Stop
                  Apologising' by Rachel Hollis and a song 'You Say' by Lauren
                  Diagle. Lost in the world of that book and the imagination
                  created by the lyrics of that song, she made a decision to
                  take a bold step that turned her pain into purpose. Less than
                  a month later, with the support of a friend and a mentor, she
                  opened a blog, Self Esteem Diary. Through that blog, she began
                  sharing her personal experiences with low self esteem to
                  create awareness about the importance of self esteem and the
                  effects of low self esteem. She had high hopes that other
                  young people going through low self-esteem, especially those
                  who have no safe space to share their struggles, will see the
                  write ups, be encouraged, and know that they are not alone in
                  their struggle and it is possible to overcome low self esteem.
                  While growing up, she experienced sibling comparison and body
                  shaming a lot which tore her self esteem into shreds to the
                  point where she was scared of looking into mirrors. She was
                  fatter than her elder sisters and that put her on the
                  receiving end of many cruel jokes and unsolicited advice.

                <p className="font-Poiret my-3  text-justify">
                  Many times, "well-meaning" individuals would give blunt advice
                  on how she needed to watch her body weight because she would
                  look unattractive to men when she grew older. She turned to
                  read fiction books as a solace and an escape from her reality,
                  and she transferred that passion to her academic books. In one
                  of her write ups, she wrote:
                </p>
                <p className="font-Poiret my-3  text-justify italic ">
                  "If I'm not good at anything, at least, I can study hard & no
                  one can take that away from me. It worked for my self-esteem,
                  especially when I started collecting prizes for being the best
                  in different subjects, until another issue came up. The same
                  "well-meaning" individuals started advising me to tone down my
                  academic achievements because "men don't like intelligent
                  women. They are not submissive". I heard a lot & went through
                  a lot of things that tore my self-esteem into shreds. By the
                  time I got into the University, the girl who used to represent
                  her school in debates could no longer speak in class for fear
                  of being noticed. I believed when people saw me, all they saw
                  was my size. I could not look into a mirror because it
                  reminded me of their words. Years later, conversations with
                  coursemates revealed two things.<br></br> 1- While I was going
                  through that phase, they thought I just loved keeping to
                  myself. Many could not imagine that I had chronic low
                  self-esteem.
                  <br />
                  2-Many young people are going through low self-esteem like I
                  did but they have no one to share with & no help because
                  little attention is given to self-esteem issues, despite their
                  importance".
                </p>
                <p className="font-Poiret my-3  text-justify">
                  Some months after she began the blog, it became clear that she
                  needed to do more by reaching out to more young people through
                  other channels. So, she opened a Facebook group and created
                  Instagram and Twitter pages. With financial support from a
                  sibling, she paid for a canva class and learnt how to do basic
                  graphic designs to begin sharing content on those social media
                  platforms. In a short while, the Facebook Community grew to
                  over 2,600 people spanning different countries.

                <p className="font-Poiret my-3  text-justify">
                  That girl is now the Executive Director of Initiative for Self
                  Esteem Education and Advocacy (ISEEA).
                </p>
                <p className="font-Poiret my-3  text-justify">
                  At the fore of all that ISEEA does is the question: "What can
                  we do to help more more young people going through low self
                  esteem?" This question drove her to set up a team and in
                  February 2022, they executed their first offline project,
                  Hangout 1.0, to take the message about the importance of
                  self-esteem offline and into the streets.
                </p>
                <p className="font-Poiret my-3  text-justify">
                  During this time, the need to place structures became
                  important and so, a few months later, on 20th July 2022, what
                  began as a blog with the name Self Esteem Diary became
                  registered as a Not for Profit Organisation with the name
                  Initiative for Self Esteem Education and Advocacy. During the
                  registration process, the ED heard a distressing story about a
                  young teenage girl below 18 years, living in a rural community
                  in Abuja, Nigeria. The young girl had an extremely abusive
                  father who threatened to kill her and her siblings and burnt
                  their clothes occasionally. She met a young man online who
                  convinced her of his love and asked for hide pictures which
                  she sent. Unfortunately, those pictures were exposed online.
                  With her team, she swung into action, paid visits to the
                  community to gather more information and then they planned and
                  executed ISEEAs first community advocacy project themed
                  Project H.E.L.P. (Help Eradicate Low Self Esteem and Other
                  Vices in Young People). The journey to eradicating low self
                  esteem is a long one but the ISEEA team is convinced that
                  every child helped can make a difference and become an agent
                  of positive change to others. You can support us by
                  volunteering your time and expertise or your financial
                  resources.
